### Data organization

#### Project and Analysis


The data used for a single valuation is stored under an **Analysis**. Each Analysis has a name and a date. All information about properties, assumptions, valuation settings etc. contained in the Analysis is considered valid as of the analysis date (or valuation date).

Any Analysis is always a part of a **Project**. Every Project must hold at least one Analysis, but may hold an unlimited number of them. A set of properties subject to valuation may be constant throughout every Analysis or varying. Same properties valued time and time again can be later compared like-for-like.

A valuer may wish to organize valuation data in such manner that the name of the Project is the name of a property portfolio or a name of the valuer's client. Therefore every Analysis made under that Project will be stored chronologically and it will be easy to navigate between them or use their data to cross-compare assumptions or properties' appraised values over time. E.g.:

|Project name|Analysis name|Valuation date|
|Acme Property Portfolio|End-of-year valuation|31.12.2013|
|Acme Property Portfolio|Valuation H1 2013|01.07.2013|
|Acme Property Portfolio|Ad Hoc Valuation|23.03.2013|

#### Properties, Buildings, Land Plots, and other assets

Every property, be it a building, a land plot or a combination of any number of buildings or land plots considered to be a part of the same property asset are organized under a **Property**. Every property must have a name, main use (office, retail, etc.), and country of its location defined. Other details are optional. Any one property can include any number of the following property types:

* Land plot
* Standalone building
* High-rise building
* Part of a building
* Individual house / Mansion
* Built-in premises
* Temporary building
* Building rights
* Utilities

It is possible to define any types of assets belonging to the same property, including equipment, or buildings rights, which has its own estimated or book value and is subject to valuation.

Presumably, evrey **Building** included in one and the same property have the same address, however, it is possible to assign a different name or a different address to every particular building belonging to the same property (e.g. when buildings have a letter or a number, or a different street address, at a corner location), e.g.:

|Property name|Property address|Building name|Building address|
|Atrium Center|Main Street 25|Atrium Offices|Main Street 25A|
|Atrium Center|Main Street 25|Atrium Retail Gallery|Main Street 25B|
|Atrium Center|Main Street 25|Atrium Hotel & Congress Building|Side Street 4|

#### Operating Expenses


The data used for a single valuation is stored under an **Analysis**. Each analysis has a name and a date. All information about properties, assumptions, valuation settings etc. is considered valid as of the analysis date (or valuation date).

A single analysis is always a part of a **Project**. Projects hold a series of analyses. A set of properties subject to valuation may be constant throughout all the analyses or varying.

A valuer may wish to organize valuation data in such manner that the name of the project is the name of a property portfolio or a name of the valuer's client. Therefore all analyses made under that project will have be stored chronologically and it will be easy to navigate between them or use their data to cross-compare assumptions or properties' appraised values over time. E.g.:

|Project name|Analysis name|Valuation date|
|Acme Property Portfolio|End-of-year valuation|31.12.2013|
|Acme Property Portfolio|Valuation H1 2013|01.07.2013|
|Acme Property Portfolio|Ad Hoc Valuation|23.03.2013|
