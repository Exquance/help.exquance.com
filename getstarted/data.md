### Data organization

#### Project and Analysis


The data used for a single valuation is stored under an **Analysis**. Each `Analysis` has a name and a date. All information about properties, assumptions, valuation settings etc. contained in the `Analysis` is considered valid as of the analysis date (or valuation date).

Any `Analysis` is always a part of a **Project**. Every `Project` must hold at least one `Analysis`, but may hold an unlimited number of them. A set of properties subject to valuation may be constant throughout every `Analysis` or varying. Same properties valued time and time again can be later compared like-for-like.

A valuer may wish to organize valuation data in such manner that the name of the `Project` is the name of a property portfolio or a name of the valuer's client. Therefore every `Analysis` made under that `Project` will be stored chronologically and it will be easy to navigate between them or use their data to cross-compare assumptions or properties' appraised values over time. E.g.:

|Project name|Analysis name|Valuation date|
|Acme Property Portfolio|End-of-year valuation|31.12.2013|
|Acme Property Portfolio|Valuation H1 2013|01.07.2013|
|Acme Property Portfolio|Ad Hoc Valuation|23.03.2013|
